# Our pathway analysis showcases that the knockdown of MDM2 (a negative regulator of P53) does increase immune response by upregulating genes. Additionally, I analyzed two TNBC cell lines that highlighted dramatically different transcriptomes. From the PCA plot and heatmaps, we see that PROTAC also had similar effectiveness as MDM2 treatment groups.
